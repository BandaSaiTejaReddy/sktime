Mission statement
-----------------

sktime enables understandable and composable machine learning
with time series. It provides `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_ compatible algorithms
and model composition tools, supported by a clear taxonomy of
learning tasks, with instructive documentation & a friendly community.


History
-------

sktime was started in April 2019 as a collaborative project between
Franz Király, Markus Löning, Tony Bagnall and Jason
Lines.
